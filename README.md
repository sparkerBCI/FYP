# Brain Computer Interface Controlled, 3-D Printed Prosthetic Hand

This is an Electrical Engineering Final Year Project by Samuel Parker, from the University of Newcastle.


### Scope
The project will attempt to conduct a real-time frequency analysis of on-line EEG data. The frequency content will then be classified into "Hand Open" or "Hand Closed" using an appropriate classification algorithm. Once classified, the state will be used to control the servos in the 3D printed prosthetic hand. The goal of the project is to achieve realtime, neurally controlled grasping.
